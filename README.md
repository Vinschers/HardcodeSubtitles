# HardcodeSubtitles
An simple app that embed subtitles from your mkv video into mp4.

##Requirements
To make HardcodeSubtitles work properly, you will need to install HandBrakeCLI, which can be found here: https://handbrake.fr/downloads2.php

##Usage
When you first open the .exe file, you will have to open the folder containing your mkv videos. When you click OK, a bunch of cmd windows will pop up, each window for each file. Once the process is done, you may close all the cmd windows and your folder should be filled with both mkv and mp4 files. Just delete the unwanted mkv and have fun with your new mp4 video!

##Attention
The embed process always use 100% of CPU, so it is recommended to do it when you are not going to use your computer. Its lenght vary depending on the number of files and their size.
